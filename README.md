## Description

[_Deployed Tech Blog Application!_](https://tech-blog-app14.herokuapp.com/)

This application is a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.
It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
